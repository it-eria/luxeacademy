                <h2>Josh Cole</h2>
                <p>It doesn’t matter one bit what you choose to do in life, just make sure your happy doing it”. Words spoken into his life by his dad and words that Josh lives by today. Born in Phoenix, AZ, the son of a sculptor-biker dad and a hippy-chick-biker
                    mom, Josh found plenty of opportunity to be creative. Since he was a child Josh watched his mom’s creativity in the form of beautiful pottery making, and his dad’s creativity birthed in the form of sculpture. Watching these two work
                    was nothing less than inspirational and a model of his dad’s words in action.</p>
                <p>With many years working in both digital and print creative, Josh prides himself on connecting the dots between the online and offline worlds, and traveling the intersection between the visual and experiential arts. To Josh, there is something
                    very special about understanding how we communicate and how that communication affects us while identifying and solving problems that present themselves within this area.</p>
                <p>While Josh certainly loves working within digital and interactive design, he also has a deep passion for both photography and video; a passion that has earned him a variety of awards, publication and gallery shows. He also spends time
                    running a lifestyle brand called Royal 9. When pried away from the computer he can be found engrossed in watching movies, fishing and traveling, with his wife and son in Nashville, TN.</p>
